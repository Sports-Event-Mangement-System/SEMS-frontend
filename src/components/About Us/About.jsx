                About Our Sports Management System
              </h1>
              <br />
              <p>
                We are CSIT 7th semester students dedicated to developing our
                final project, the Sports Event Management System. This
                innovative web platform is designed to streamline the
                organization of sports events and leagues.
                <br /> By simplifying match scheduling, team management, and
                performance tracking, it ensures an efficient process for both
                organizers and participants.
                <br /> Our system supports two primary roles: admins and regular
                users. Regular users can easily register their teams for
                tournaments and track their progress through a user-friendly
                interface. Meanwhile, admins have the capability to organize
                tournaments, manage team registrations, schedule matches, and
                send notifications using a comprehensive admin dashboard.
                <br /> By automating these tasks, the platform provides a
                seamless experience for everyone involved, making it a
                comprehensive solution for effective sports event management.
